#  Sellers Analysis ResellerSales, AdventureWorks 2022
Using the AdventureWorks database, a fictional company specialized in bicycle manufacturing and sales, we conducted an analysis to identify the best and worst performers in the Reseller Sales channel, focusing on the years 2011 to 2013. This analysis enabled us to understand who the sellers are, the regions they sell to, and which products they sell the most.


By downloading the AdventureWorksDW2022.bak file and restoring it in SQL Server, it is possible to run each SQL query used in this analysis and obtain the same results presented.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We started the project by understanding each object, table, field, data type, and relationship within the AdventureWorks data model. After identifying the customer and sales tables, we developed SQL scripts to explore the data and extract initial insights during the exploratory data analysis (EDA), such as: <br><br>
- distinct empoyee <br>
- Sales By Product <br>
- Total Sales By Employers <br>
- Top 5 best Sellers <br>
- Country of Best Sellers

## Worst Sellers Analysis

To identify the worst-performing salespeople, we first created a CTE (Common Table Expression) called SalesByPerson, which consolidates reseller sales data at the salesperson level. Although this analysis could be done using subqueries or temporary tables, the CTE approach makes the logic clearer, more organized, and easier to reuse.

Inside the CTE, we join the FactResellerSales table with DimEmployee to associate each sale with the corresponding salesperson. At this stage, we aggregate the data by employee and calculate the main performance indicators:

TotalSales: total revenue generated by each salesperson

TotalQuantity: total number of products sold

TotalOrders: number of distinct orders handled

We also create a Salesperson field by concatenating first and last names, improving readability and making the output more suitable for business analysis.

With the aggregated data ready, the final query simply selects the bottom 5 salespeople, ordering the results by TotalSales in ascending order. This allows management to quickly identify underperforming salespeople and take strategic actions, such as targeted training, performance improvement plans, or closer monitoring. <br>

By analyzing these data, we were able to deliver the exact insights management needed to take action. The analysis supports the creation of targeted incentive plans for underperforming salespeople, helping them reach their full potential while increasing overall revenue and profitability for the company.

## Technical SQL Conclusion

SQL is a powerful language that allows us to analyze, extract, manipulate, and present data from a database in a fast and efficient way, directly from the data source. It is highly reliable for validating information and performing in-depth analysis. However, SQL is not a dynamic or visual tool. Each new analytical perspective requires rewriting queries, and results are always displayed in tabular format, which makes the analysis less interactive compared to visualization tools such as dashboards.

My conclusion is that SQL is a fundamental skill in any data project and should be the first tool used when exploring and understanding a database. It ensures data accuracy and consistency before moving to other tools, such as Power BI, for visualization and storytelling. There is no single “best” tool—there are tools that are better suited to specific business needs. The key is to choose the right tool based on the objectives and requirements of each data project.

## Dashboard Power BI

Following the idea that SQL is not the best tool for dynamic and visual analysis, I developed a dashboard focused on analyzing salespeople using the same AdventureWorks database.

Since Power BI allows dynamic and visual analysis in a simple way, with less DAX code and full user interaction, I performed an exploratory analysis comparing sales quantity and revenue between the best and worst salespeople.

From this analysis, we reached the following conclusions:

The top salespeople sell mainly to the United States.

The products they sell the most belong to the Bikes category.

There was sales growth from 2011 to 2013.

For this reason, Power BI is an extremely important tool, as it allows end users to apply their own filters and explore the data dynamically, making analysis easier and more intuitive.
